# A Demo for the UCD API Project
This site is built with Angular to show off a couple capabilities of the UC Davis API I recently wrote.  
It will allow visitors to view, search, and download data from the API for their convenience and slightly document the API for developers

Enjoy the demo!

## Upcoming Features
* API Documentation
  * Include live demo and the data converted into table form for viewing
  * Include source code for replicating the call
  * Linked from search pages and sidebar
* Better UI/UX for viewing information

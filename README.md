# A Demo for the UCD API Project
This site is built with Angular to show off a couple capabilities of the UC Davis API I recently wrote.  
It will allow visitors to view, search, and download data from the API for their convenience and slightly document the API for developers

Enjoy the demo!

## Upcoming Features
* API Documentation
  * Include live demos and a table form of the resulting for viewing
  * Include source code for replicating certain API calls
  * Link from search pages
* Better UI/UX for viewing information
* Repackage the API calls into a reusable file for easy import and use
  * This should replace the Angular service and be downloadable
	* Simple library interface!
